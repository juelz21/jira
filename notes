SCRUM PROCESS
---------------

The Agile Process
====================
Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers
faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but
consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.

Software
functionality 1- Plan - Implement - Test - Review

THis is the agile process.
